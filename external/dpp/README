DSP Process Platform (DPP) module directory description:

DPP    : DSP Process Platform
DPI    : DSP Process Interface
HAL    : Hardware Abstract Layer
OSAL   : Operation System Abstract Layer

Rules:
1. header file arrange rule
a. inc directory in each module folder is for external module usage.
b. module internal header file should be put along with the implement file.
c. header file should not contain any relative path or absolute path, all include path should be keep in Makefile.
2. compiling system rule
a. build final binary and library will be install to out/ directory.
3. header file include order
a. MODULE_TAG
b. system header
c. module header

NOTE:
1. when run on window pthreadVC2.dll needed to be copied to the system directory.
