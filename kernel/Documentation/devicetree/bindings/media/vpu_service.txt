* Rockchip Video Process Unit (VPU)

Rockchip Video Process Unit (VPU) is the IP present in Rockchip SoCs which
supports video decoding and encoding functionalities.
The VPU device driver can encode video raw sequences to h.264 elementary
streams, vp8 ivf and jpeg. decode variable format video streams.

Required properties:
  - compatible : value should be either one among the following
	(a) "vpu_service" for a common version present in Rockchip SoCs
	(b) "rockchip,rk322xh-vdpu" for the vpu service present in rk322xh SoC

  - reg : Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory
	  mapped region.

  - interrupts : RKVENC interrupt number to the CPU.

  - clocks : RKVENC clock source.

Optional properties:

  - resets : The reset controller to reset the ip.

  - rockchip,grf : general register set, used to configure the general feature
		   in the Rockchip SoCs.

Example:
SoC specific DT entry:

vdpu: vpu_service@ff350000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk322x-vdpu", "vpu_service";
	rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
	iommu_enabled = <1>;
	reg = <0x0 0xff350000 0x0 0x400>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 9 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&aclk_vpu>, <&clk_gates11 8>;
	clock-names = "aclk_vcodec", "hclk_vcodec";
	resets = <&reset RK322XH_SRST_VCODEC_H>,
		<&reset RK322XH_SRST_VCODEC_A>;
	reset-names = "video_h", "video_a";
	dev_mode = <0>;
	name = "vpu_service";
	status = "disabled";
};

Board specific DT entry:

vdpu {
	status = "okay";
};
