* Rockchip MPP (Media Process Platform) service

Rockchip mpp service is a common task handling service module in kernel.
mpp service proivdes two main functions:
1. serializing userspace task handling by different task handling status list.
2. providing standard task based hardware transaction flow by work queue for
   each hardware.

Because some multimedia devices in Rockchip SoCs share the resources, such
as RK312x, vpu and rkvdec share the registers and inner ram, and these devices
cannot running at the same time, therefor, a service maintain unit queue is
required.

Required properties:
  - compatible : value should be either one among the following
	(a) "rockchip,mpp_service" for a common version present in Rockchip SoCs

Optional properties:

  - reg : Physical base address of the combo IP registers and length of memory
	  mapped region.

Example:
SoC specific DT entry:

rkvenc_srv: rkvenc_srv {
	compatible = "rockchip,mpp_service";
};
